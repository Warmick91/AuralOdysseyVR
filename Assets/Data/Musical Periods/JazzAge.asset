  infoText: "     The Jazz Age, also known as the Roaring Twenties, was a time when
    jazz music and dance styles became wildly popular, not only in the United States,
    where it was born, but also across the globe. It's worth noting that, although
    the Jazz Age is primarily associated with the period between the end of World
    War I in 1918 and the start of the Great Depression in 1929, the influence of
    jazz music didn't stop there, but continued to be significant, overlapping into
    subsequent musical periods.\n\r\nThe war was over, the economy was booming, and
    folks were just ready to have a good time. And jazz? It was the soundtrack to
    all of that. Born in the African American communities of New Orleans, jazz music
    broke many of the rules of traditional Western music. The rhythm, the improvisation,
    the soul \u2013 it was unlike anything people had heard before. It was innovative,
    lively, and fun, just like the decade itself.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Jazz Age
    also marked a shift towards a more liberal society. People were pushing boundaries
    and breaking societal norms. Women, known as flappers, were wearing shorter dresses,
    bobbing their hair, and enjoying a newfound freedom. Jazz, with its vibrant energy
    and disregard for musical conventions, perfectly mirrored these societal changes.\r\n\r\nIn
    this era, the star power of artists like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington was
    on the rise. They were not just musicians; they were influencers who played a
    huge role in spreading jazz music and culture. Jazz clubs were springing up in
    cities everywhere, and people couldn't get enough of the new sound. Armstrong's
    innovative trumpet playing and warm, charismatic voice, along with Ellington's
    genius as a composer and band leader, left an indelible mark on the music world.
    Their impact on jazz is immeasurable and continues to inspire musicians today.\r\n\r\nBut
    it wasn't all smooth sailing. While the Jazz Age was a time of great cultural
    growth and social change, it was also a time of racial tension and class struggle.
    Despite these challenges, or perhaps because of them, jazz continued to evolve,
    influence and inspire, making its mark as one of the most significant cultural
    movements of the 20th century. And even after the Wall Street crash in 1929 signalled
    the end of the Roaring Twenties, jazz didn't miss a beat. It continued to grow,
    shaping and being shaped by the world around it.\r\n\r\nSome great tunes from
    this era to check out: \"West End Blues\" by Louis Armstrong and \"It Don't Mean
    a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" by Duke Ellington."
