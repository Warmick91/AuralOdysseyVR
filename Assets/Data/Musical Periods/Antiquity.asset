  infoText: "     In the early days, music came to life in three main parts of the
    world: Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. In Mesopotamia, people mostly sang, but
    they also invented some of the first instruments like the lyre, harp, and flute.
    Their music was deeply tied to the cosmos - they thought of it as a kind of science,
    and mostly played it during royal and religious ceremonies.\nIt was here in Mesopotamia
    where they started studying the spaces between sounds - what we call intervals.
    They connected these intervals with perfect proportions found in the universe
    and nature. This way of seeing music as a calculation-based science stayed around
    until the late Middle Ages.\r\n\nOver in Egypt, they started making music that
    wasn't just for religious rituals, so secular music was born. That's why we find
    more instruments from there, like the sistrum (a type of rattle), the Pan flute,
    harp, lyre, lute, and trumpet. Here, women were also allowed to make music.\r\nBut
    the real game-changer for European culture was Ancient Greece. Music in Greece
    was a little different from what we're used to today. It was always combined
    with dance and poetry to make a kind of mash-up genre (syncretism).\n\n\rMusic
    was super important for the Greeks - you can tell because it pops up a lot in
    their mythology, with many myths telling tales about music, instruments, and
    how they were discovered. Music was everywhere in Greece, in both serious and
    fun situations. It was played during major national ceremonies, during many processions
    and festivals where they would sing songs of praise to the gods, and even during
    the Olympic Games. They also had their own music competition during the Pythian
    Games in Delphi where contestants sang with or played the kithara (a type of
    lyre) and the aulos (a type of flute).\n\r\nMusic was also a big part of Greek
    drama. A soloist and a chorus singing dialogue was the main feature of ancient
    theater. Since music was seen as a mathematical science, the Greek philosopher
    Pythagoras played a big part in developing it. He measured the spaces between
    sounds on a one-string instrument (the monochord), showing that they were a reflection
    of the harmony of the universe. In Ancient Greece, they also created the first
    musical scales that were used all the way up until the Baroque period, and they
    invented the first system of musical notation.\r\n\nThe Greeks had a cool collection
    of instruments, including the cithara, lyre, harp, psaltery, trumpet, horn, aulos,
    Pan flute, and the syrinx.\r"
