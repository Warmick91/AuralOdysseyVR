  infoText: "      The prehistoric era in world history kicked off around 3 million
    years ago, when our handy friend homo habilis appeared on the scene. In Europe,
    about 1.8 million years ago, his successor, homo erectus - the upright man -
    showed up. The first signs of human activity on our continent are traced back
    to what is now Spain. But here's the thing: even though this is the longest period
    in human history, we don't know a ton about the music or cultural development
    because it's really hard to study.\r\n\nWe do think, though, that music has been
    hanging out with humans since the get-go, serving all kinds of purposes.\r\nThere
    are a few theories about what music might have meant to early humans. Maybe it
    was tied to the development of speech, human or bird calls, and shouts.\n\nThese
    calls also played a part in communication. Music was probably also tied to human
    emotions, expressed through primal shouts; or to movement, like clapping, stomping,
    hitting different body parts, and creating all sorts of sounds that way.\r\n\nThis
    last theory is backed up by the discovery of prehistoric instruments. Mainly,
    we're talking about drums made from hollow tree trunks, things that could be
    hit: sticks, slabs, tubes, and rattles made from organic materials.\r\nFrom the
    Paleolithic era, we have the first flutes, whistles, and pipes made from bones,
    like bird or reindeer bones, with holes made by humans. One of the most famous
    finds from the Ice Age is a 5-hole flute found in the Hohle Fels cave in Germany.
    It's dated to about 35,000 years ago, and the coolest part is, the holes are
    arranged in such a way that it can play a pentatonic scale - a scale still used
    today, especially in popular music like blues, rock, jazz, pop.\n\r\nFrom the
    Bronze Age, we have metal horns, which were built to resemble animal horns. This
    instrument was probably used for communication (it could be heard from a long
    distance) and was used during hunts. Excavations and cave paintings indicate
    the instrument was primarily found in Scandinavia - Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.
    It's called the Lur.\r\n\nWe also learn about the prehistoric era from cave paintings.
    From these sources, we can tell that music had a ritual and magical function.
    It was present during important tribal events, connected with fertility, celebrating
    births and deaths, initiation rituals, hunting, symbolism of the seasons, earth,
    moon phases, and so on.\r"
