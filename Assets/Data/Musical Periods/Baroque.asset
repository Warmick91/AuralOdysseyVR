  infoText: "     The Baroque era in music kicked off with the first-ever opera (then
    called 'dramma per musica') being performed in 1600. It was a work called \"Dafne\"
    by Jacopo Peri. The era wrapped up with the death of Baroque music master Johann
    Sebastian Bach in 1750.\n\r\nEarly on, what set Baroque apart from the Renaissance
    era was that it added a whole lot of emotion to music. They created a new style
    called accompanied monody, which was a break away from the complex polyphonic
    vocal music of the Renaissance. Instead of choirs and lots of singers, there
    was one soloist and an accompanying instrument. This is where the harpsichord,
    one of the key instruments of the Baroque era, started to shine (this is the
    older sibling of the piano, which was created later). The harpsichord was used
    to play the basso continuo, also known as the figured bass. Meanwhile, the singer
    would perform the vocal part, full of dramatic, emotion-packed singing and spoken
    word. This style was mainly used in early Baroque operas and was used by creators
    like the composers of the Florentine Camerata and Claudio Monteverdi.\n\r\nAs
    time went on, opera continued to evolve and became one of the most important
    types of music that used both voice and instruments (there were also other types,
    like cantatas, oratorios, and passions). But, for the first time in music history,
    instrumental music started to take center stage.\n\r\nNew types of music popped
    up, like instrumental concerts featuring a main solo instrument and an accompanying
    orchestra, the concerto grosso where two groups of instruments would have a musical
    dialogue, and the sonata, a genre for one (or sometimes two) solo instruments.
    Technology for making instruments got better, with workshops making violins,
    violas, lutes. High-born folks were learning to play instruments, dance suites
    were played by instrumental ensembles at courts, and there was a blossoming of
    virtuosity in playing. The Baroque period was definitely all about the instruments.\r\n\nAnother
    major development was the introduction of a new system of harmony - functional
    harmony. From then on, compositions didn't rely on the modal scale system known
    since ancient times, but on the major-minor system and variations of the two
    basic scales (major and minor) along with keys and degrees. This system was developed
    by music theorist and composer Jean-Philippe Rameau, and it was perfectly illustrated
    in practice by the most famous Baroque composer - Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach
    composed 'Das Wohltemperierte Klavier', which is a collection of pieces for each
    key, created for the harpsichord. This collection contains 48 preludes and fugues
    and is still a must-learn for any pianist today.\r\n\nThe most important composer
    of the Baroque era was the aforementioned Johann Sebastian Bach - one of the
    most significant musical creators of all time. He composed over a thousand pieces,
    and was a musical genius. He created loads of works for the harpsichord and organ,
    including the famous Toccata and Fugue in D minor, St. Matthew Passion, Mass
    in B minor, Brandenburg Concertos and many others.\r\n\nAnother big name from
    this era was George Frideric Handel, the composer of the oratorio 'Messiah' which
    has the famous 'Hallelujah' as one of its parts. There was also Antonio Vivaldi
    - a brilliant violinist, known for his 'Four Seasons' cycle.\r"
