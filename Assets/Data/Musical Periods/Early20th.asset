  infoText: "The early 20th century was a fascinating time for music, as composers
    began exploring paths less traveled by their predecessors. One such avenue was
    atonal music, a radical departure from traditional tonality that defied expectations.
    Think of composers like Arnold Schoenberg, who broke away from conventional tonal
    harmony and delivered compositions that kept listeners on their toes.\r\n\nThis
    era also saw Western music embracing influences from around the globe. A prime
    example is Claude Debussy, who was profoundly influenced by the sound of gamelan
    music from Bali and Java. His compositions blend Western and Eastern elements,
    resulting in a unique musical style that many associate with the impressionist
    movement.\r\n\nAnd let's not forget Igor Stravinsky. His ballet score for \"The
    Rite of Spring\" was a game-changer. Stravinsky's daring musical approach in
    this piece was so revolutionary, that its premiere sparked a riot amongst the
    audience.\r\n\nThe dawn of the 20th century was a time of fresh ideas and bold
    experimentation in music, but it was also a time of significant upheaval. World
    War I, happening from 1914 to 1918, cast a long shadow over the era. The war
    brought about drastic changes in society, and these shifts were reflected in
    the music of the time. Composers began to express the complexity of the human
    experience, including the profound pain and uncertainty brought about by the
    war.\r\n\nHowever, from the ashes of war, a creative spark was ignited. The post-war
    period saw the emergence of jazz from America, which would later give birth to
    the Jazz Age. Artists like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald started making
    waves with their soulful and innovative sounds, laying the foundation for many
    popular music genres to come, crafting a distinct and dynamic musical language
    that was all about feeling and spontaneity. This fusion of various music styles
    led to the birth of big band swing, which became wildly popular and marked an
    important milestone in the Jazz Age.\r\n\nAnother crucial development of the
    early 20th century was the birth of electronic music. This was truly groundbreaking,
    as it opened up a whole new sound world previously unimaginable. Composers such
    as Edgard Var\xE8se began experimenting with electronic instruments and new technologies,
    resulting in unique compositions that broadened the horizons of what music could
    be. Also worth noting is the Theremin, one of the first electronic musical instruments,
    invented by Leon Theremin. It was played without physical contact and had a distinctive
    sound that's often associated with eerie, sci-fi movie soundtracks.\r\n\nIn summary,
    the early 20th century was an era marked by trailblazing innovations and genre-blending
    experimentations, resulting in a rich tapestry of musical expressions that continue
    to influence music to this day.\r\n"
