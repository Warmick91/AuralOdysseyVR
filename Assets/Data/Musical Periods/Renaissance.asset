  infoText: "     The Renaissance in music happened from the first half of the 15th
    century and ran until around 1600. This period was when the opera genre started
    to pop up and marked a new chapter in music history.\r\n\nThe music of the Renaissance
    was really like a continuation of the Medieval period's achievements, mainly
    vocal music and the development of polyphony. But this time, they really stepped
    up the game. The polyphony got more complex and relied on more sophisticated
    compositional techniques. They had tricks like quoting a melody from one composition
    in another (the parody technique), imitating the melody of one voice in the next
    (which is pretty clear in a canon, like in the popular melody \"Panie Janie\"),
    or mimicking sounds of nature or surroundings (imitazione della natura).\r\n\nVocal
    music was still going strong, with vocalists singing in quartets, quintets, sextets,
    etc. Choirs sang, and towards the end of the period, they even started to introduce
    multi-choir compositions. These were pieces created for multiple choirs placed
    in different parts of the church to create a feeling of spacious sound enveloping
    the listeners.\r\n\nVocal music still had a religious vibe and was primarily
    used for church services. That's why the most popular genres in the Renaissance
    were the mass, psalm, hymn, or motet \u2013 songs with religious text.\r\nAlongside
    vocal music, instruments and secular music started to become more and more important.
    Court music became popular. Songs were created, usually about love, like the
    French chanson, the Italian madrigal, or pieces with a dance rhythm, like a rondo.
    The instruments you'd typically see during the Renaissance were the lute, viola,
    organs, flutes, trumpets, drums.\r\n\nSome major game-changing events for Renaissance
    music were the Reformation process, which also changed music evolution \u2013
    the Protestant chorale or Protestant religious songs were created, and the invention
    of printing. This was a huge milestone for musicians as well. The first music
    printing house started its operation in Venice. Other major centers for music
    printing in the 16th century included Paris, Antwerp, and Nuremberg.\r\n\nAs
    for the rockstars of the Renaissance, we're talking about composers from the
    Flemish center (today's Belgian territories) and France, like Josquin des Prez,
    Jacob Obrecht, Cl\xE9ment Janequin, Orlando di Lasso, and also Giovanni Pierluigi
    da Palestrina, Adrian Willaert, Andrea Gabrieli, Giovanni Gabrieli.\r\n\nAnd
    if you want to get a feel of Renaissance music, check out \"Echo\" by Orlando
    di Lasso or \"Missa Papae Marcelli\" by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.\r"
