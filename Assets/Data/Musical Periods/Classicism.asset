  infoText: '     Think of "Classicism" as a style that was really popular in music,
    books, and buildings around the 18th century in Europe. This style was all about
    looking back to the time of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, trying to capture
    their sense of perfection, harmony and order.

    

    In music, this meant
    tunes in major-minor scales, pieces that were clearly organized, often broken
    into different sections, showing off skill (what we call virtuosity), and introducing
    what we now know as classical instruments.

    

    The music was mostly
    made up of one main melody supported by a backing track (we call this homophony).
    This was different from earlier music where several melodies had equal importance
    and were played at the same time.

    

    The kinds of pieces they wrote
    back then included symphonies (like a big musical journey for an orchestra),
    suites (a sequence of short musical pieces), instrumental concertos (a solo instrument
    backed up by an orchestra), and lighter, fun pieces called divertimentos.

    

    They
    also continued to write vocal music like operas (drama set to music), oratorios
    (like an opera but based on religious stories), and cantatas (like a mini oratorio).
    They even had songs that were either sung a capella (without instruments) or
    with instrument backup.

    

    Classicism was a time when music became
    a big deal for everyone, not just the kings and nobles. This led to more public
    theaters and music groups, public concerts, and more people learning to play
    instruments. It was also a time of invention and improvement of musical instruments,
    the piano being the star invention of this time.

    

    In Europe, the
    rock stars of Classicism were the "Viennese classics" - Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang
    Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven. They set the stage for many musical
    forms like the opera, symphony, and concertos, they also decided the rules of
    how to structure music pieces, which we still follow to this day.

    

    Some
    of the biggest hits of this time were Haydn''s Symphony in G Major, Mozart''s
    opera The Magic Flute and his party piece Eine kleine Nachtmusik, and Beethoven''s
    Symphony No. 5 and Symphony No. 9.'
