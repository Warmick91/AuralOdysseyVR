  infoText: "     The Middle Ages in European culture span from the 5th to the 15th
    century. The exact start and end dates aren't set in stone, but people usually
    mark the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD as the beginning, while the
    end is associated with the emergence of humanist and Renaissance ideas in the
    early 15th century.\r\n\nMost of the art born in the Middle Ages, including music,
    was closely tied to Christian philosophy and the rituals of church liturgy. This
    is why many of the works from this time are anonymous. The mindset was more about
    creating to honor God, rather than for the recognition of the artist. Another
    interesting tidbit is how music was seen in the Middle Ages - as a science, part
    of the group of mathematical disciplines.\r\n\nTypical features of medieval music
    include monophony, meaning a melody originally had only one voice, no accompaniment.
    Think of an entire choir singing in unison - that's what we call Gregorian chant.
    Polyphony, or having two, then three, and four voices in compositions, started
    to show up from the 9th century. When a piece has several voices playing together,
    we call that texture polyphony. Back in the Middle Ages, they didn't have musical
    notes as we know them today. Instead, they wrote neumes, initially without the
    staff, but this notation got more and more refined over time. The Middle Ages
    also gave us solmization, or the famous do, re, mi..., thanks to the theorist
    Guido of Arezzo. The hymn to John the Baptist, where the first syllables of each
    word were used by Guido to invent a new singing method \u2013 solmization.\r\n\nMusic
    of the Middle Ages was primarily vocal music, performed by the human voice. This
    was because there was a ban on using instruments in the church (organs were allowed
    from the 7th century). Also, only men could sing, so the most common ensemble
    was a male choir a cappella (without instrumental accompaniment). Most of the
    vocal music created in the Middle Ages was in Latin, the universal language at
    the time.\r\n\nIn addition to religious and church music, secular music was also
    created, more for entertainment. It was often made by regular folks and used
    for fun, dancing, family or court festivities. Professional poets and singers
    were usually on the move, and they were known by different names depending on
    where they created. They could be troubadours or Meistersingers. This type of
    music could be vocal or instrumental, with instruments like the lute, fidel (a
    kind of primitive violin), flutes or other pipes like shawms, horns, hurdy-gurdies,
    drums. Medieval songs told stories about everyday life, human labor, romances,
    great battles, rulers, and brave knights.\r"
